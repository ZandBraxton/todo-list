Live Demo: https://zandbraxton.github.io/todo-list/

A Todo List project created for The Odin Project. This application I used various OOP principles in creating it, as well as different JS modules to handle and separate logic. The app lets you create tasks that save to your local storage. Tasks have a date, a name, and a priority. Projects can be made to sort tasks, which have a name and description. The inbox contains all tasks that are not in a project, while the Today and Upcoming section contain all tasks that fall into those categories.
